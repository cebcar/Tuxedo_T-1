switch to macOS 10.15 (Catalina) from macOS 10.9 (Mavericks)

Motivation:
- We have been "stuck" in Mavericks for several years due to compatibility issues with Accessor.
- Many features we need, from proper display of web pages to GitHub Project Boards, are not working well under Mavericks
- New Catalina features appear to have provided much of what Accessor was for
  - further development of Accessor is now deprecated, so we are no longer stuck

Approach:
- Previously, we have attempted to install a new system complete with a standard set of tools.
- This time, we will get the system itself up and running, and then add and document tools one at a time
- Each tool will have its own documentation file.

Tools:
- macOS
