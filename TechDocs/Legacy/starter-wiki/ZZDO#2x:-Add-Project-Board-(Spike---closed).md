- *Apparently, we can change only a few GitHub settings for a repository link.
  We cannot change, for example, prohibiting editing by viewers in GitHub,
  or availability of GitHub Issues, Projects, or Pages.*
- *Attempt to create new repository link DevOps with those features enabled,
  and to add a GitHub Project Board for the new repoLink.*

- [√] establish settings to use for new repoLink
- [√] rename existing working copy (clone)
  - rename to PROJECT_NAME_Phase_1
  - store at Dev_Phase_1
- [ ] clone new working copy DevOps
  - clone repo
    - use https://; select download to .zip
  - copy .zip to ~/Dev; extract
    - extracted copy stored under its original date
- [ ] open PROJECT_NAME
  - rename PROJECT_NAME_master to PROJECT_NAME
  - open PROJECT_NAME in its development interface
- [ ] attempt to add a Project Board
- [ ] if successful, add commits and .gitignore to DevOps

- *Document each step for possible use by Accessor and DevSupport.*
