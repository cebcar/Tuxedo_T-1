# Tuxedo

*learning resources and activities for myself and my grandchildren*

This project has fun educational stuff for Penguins and adults,<br/>
along with documentation, websites, and support for devops and accessibility.
<br/><br/>
The Tuxedo is for the Penguins.

### Tuxedo parts

#### Penguins
- website containing learning resources and activities for my grandchildren
- ultimately, intention is for Tuxedo project to:
  - Tuxedo generates the content (links, ...) to be used by the kids
  - provide some customization and, hopefully, limited monitoring for parents
- at some point, Penguins could conceivably become an Open Source project

#### Repo Project Tuxedo
*content eventually expected*
- WebApp Penguins
- TechDocs: site generated from Markdown content
- DevOps *we have no separate sysadmin*
  - Shell environment
  - DevOps support
- Access
  - accessibility support for macOS and iOS
- Keymaps: project to generate standard-looking Keymap with proper keyboard symbols
- javascript / typescript support
  - typescript is apparently an object-oriented, type-safe superset of javascript

##### Eagle
*Eagle's eye view*
- Continuing Education for developer; uses a ZenHub Board
  - valuable experience for Penguins development
- high-level roadmap of Tuxedo project
- maybe a repo project containing CE notes and plans
